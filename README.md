## Project Description

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation of **Buffon’s Needle problem** in two different ways.

The program:
- Estimates the probability that a needle crosses a line  
- Uses this probability to estimate the value of **π**  
- Computes the absolute error  
- Plots how the π estimation error changes as the number of iterations increases as example.

The plot is demonstrated with experiment 1:

- Distance between lines: `D = 2`  
- Needle length: `L = 1`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `matplotlib` library  

If `matplotlib` is not installed, run:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Execution

-> After installing the requirements and navigating to the project directory, the program can be executed with: **python main.py** the program can be run, for both experimental approach, also for complete of the the graph tabs should be closed.
-> Detailed results of the experiments can be observed either in the terminal output or in the project report.
